# Make Food, Not Waste!

### A React SPA to help save food from going to waste

This app was made as part of {the jump digital school}'s full stack software engineering course, as a frontend React proof of concept project.

The idea is to encourage people to use the food they have so it doesn't go to waste. Users can sign up, add ingredients to their pantry and search for recipes using these ingredients. They can also save recipes they like for later.

Techs used:
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- React, including functional components and hooks
- Redux for state management.
- CSS3

### To do:

- :point_right: Add a landing page.
- :point_right: Fix: reloading on any URL other than the root results in 404 error.
- :point_right: Improve use of URL for state management, to improve user experience (e.g. when modals pop up, this should be reflected in URL, and user should be able to navigate back).
- :point_right: Re-factor CSS to SASS and implement CSS modules.
- :point_right: Add animation at startup.
- :point_right: Add icons for search, user account, delete etc.
- :point_right: Make the app PWA-compliant.
