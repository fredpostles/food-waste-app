# Make Food, Not Waste!

### A React SPA to help save food from going to waste

This app was made as part of {the jump digital school}'s full stack course, as a React Front-end project.

Still a work in progress. Back-end to follow.

### To do:

- :point_right: Re-factor CSS to SASS and implement CSS modules.
- :point_right: Add animation at startup.
- :point_right: Add icons for search, user account, delete etc.
- :point_right: Make the app PWA-compliant.
